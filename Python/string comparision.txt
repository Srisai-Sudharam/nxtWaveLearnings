python compares string using their unicode value

"Apple" < "apple" # True

-> ord(char)=> takes character as input and returns unicode of that string

-> chr(unicode_value) => takes unicode value and returns a string

48 - 57 (0-9)
65 - 90 (A-Z)
97 - 122(a - z)

ord method only takes a single character, if more than one character is given it raises a TypeError

Naming variables:

the name can contain alphabets and digits and underscores

the name should not start with a digit, and should not contain any special characters

snake_case # naming convention used in python

some other naming styles are

1. PascalCase
2. camelCase
